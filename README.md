# PDF-CHATBOT
This project is a PDF-based RAG chatbot using Google Gemini-Pro and FAISS. It extracts text from PDFs, chunks and embeds it using sentence-transformers, stores embeddings in FAISS, and retrieves relevant content to generate accurate answers. The chatbot provides context-aware responses by combining retrieved data with LLM insights. ðŸš€
